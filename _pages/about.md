Originally from India, I have been fascinated by math since I was a kid. In high school, I participated in math olympiads, clearing the [Indian National Mathematical Olympiad](https://olympiads.hbcse.tifr.res.in/mathematical-olympiad-2025-2026/) twice and winning a bronze medal at the [Asian Pacific Mathematics Olympiad](https://www.apmo-official.org/). I also authored the book [Modern Olympiad Number Theory](https://www.academia.edu/44512122/Modern_Olympiad_Number_Theory). 

At [UMass Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/), I continued my interest in math by taking graduate courses in pure math, specializing in algebraic geometry. I was a student of [Professor Jenia Tevelev](https://www.umass.edu/mathematics-statistics/about/directory/jenia-tevelev) and wrote a paper in birational geometry under his guidance, the preprint of which is on arXiv. I worked on my honors thesis under [Professor Paul Hacking](https://www.umass.edu/mathematics-statistics/about/directory/paul-hacking) on constructing a potential counterexample to a conjecture of [János Kollár](https://web.math.princeton.edu/~kollar/) on smoothings of rational singularities.

I participated in the [UMass math REU](https://sites.google.com/umass.edu/math-stat-reu) and was invited to attend the [IAS PCMI 2024](https://www.ias.edu/pcmi/pcmi-2024-research-program) program on motivic homotopy theory. I was also the President of the [Integrated Math Majors Club](https://umassamherst.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/integratedmathmajors) at UMass, where we organized panels, competitions (such as the first [UMass integration bee](https://www.umass.edu/mathematics-statistics/integration-bee)) and events. 

I will be pursuing graduate school at the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/en) starting Autumn 2025.
