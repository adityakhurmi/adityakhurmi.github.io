<!-- ### I am an incoming math graduate student at the University of Chicago, starting Autumn '25. 

### I am interested in algebraic geometry, and my past research was in birational geometry. -->

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Originally from India, I have been fascinated by math since I was a kid. In high school, I participated in math olympiads, clearing the [Indian National Mathematical Olympiad](https://olympiads.hbcse.tifr.res.in/mathematical-olympiad-2025-2026/) twice and winning a bronze medal at the [Asian Pacific Mathematics Olympiad](https://www.apmo-official.org/). I also authored the book [Modern Olympiad Number Theory](https://www.academia.edu/44512122/Modern_Olympiad_Number_Theory). 

At [UMass Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/), I continued my interest in math by taking graduate courses in pure math, specializing in algebraic geometry. I was a student of [Professor Jenia Tevelev](https://www.umass.edu/mathematics-statistics/about/directory/jenia-tevelev) and wrote a paper in birational geometry under his guidance, the preprint of which is on arXiv, see [arXiv:2410.15301](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15301). I worked on my honors thesis under [Professor Paul Hacking](https://www.umass.edu/mathematics-statistics/about/directory/paul-hacking) on a conjecture of [János Kollár](https://web.math.princeton.edu/~kollar/) on smoothings of rational singularities, and a potential counterexample. 

I attended the [math REU](https://sites.google.com/umass.edu/math-stat-reu) at UMass twice and was invited to attend the [IAS PCMI 2024](https://www.ias.edu/pcmi/pcmi-2024-research-program) program on motivic homotopy theory. I was also the President of the [Integrated Math Majors Club](https://umassamherst.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/integratedmathmajors) at UMass, where we organized panels, competitions (such as a [UMass integration bee](https://www.umass.edu/mathematics-statistics/integration-bee)) and events. 

I will be pursuing graduate school at the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/en) starting Autumn 2025.
